    "In this lab, we'll learn how to use the Central Limit Theorem to work with non-normally distributed datasets as if they were normally distributed.  \n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "* Determine if a dataset is normal or non-normal\n",
    "* Create a function to sample with replacement and generate sample means\n",
    "* Create a sample distribution of sample means\n",
    "* Answer questions about non-normally distributed datasets by working with the normally distributed sample distribution of sample means.  \n",
